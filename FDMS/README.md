# FDMS Document Migration System - POC Summary

## Purpose
This Proof of Concept demonstrates an automated system for migrating employee documents from legacy HR systems to a modern, secure cloud-based document management solution.

## Business Benefits
- Centralized document management for all employee records
- Enhanced security with encrypted document storage
- Improved document searchability and accessibility
- Automated categorization of documents (Identity, Employment, Payroll)
- Reduced manual effort in document handling
- Compliance with document retention policies

## Features Demonstrated
1. Document Processing
   - Automatic extraction from existing HR systems
   - Smart categorization of documents (Passport, Visa, Contracts, Payslips)
   - Secure cloud storage with encryption
   - Searchable document metadata

2. Security & Compliance
   - Encrypted document storage
   - Secure access controls
   - Audit trail of all document operations
   - Automated logging and monitoring

3. System Integration
   - Integration with existing HR databases
   - Connection with cloud storage
   - Metadata management system

## Sample Document Categories
- Identity Documents (Passport, Visa)
- Employment Documents (Contracts)
- Payroll Documents (Payslips)
- Additional categories can be added as needed

## Next Phase Recommendations
1. Implement batch processing for large-scale migration
2. Add user interface for document management
3. Create dashboard for migration progress monitoring
4. Enhance search capabilities
5. Add document retention policy automation

## Timeline
- POC Development: Completed
- Next Phase: Ready for review and planning

## Features

- Extracts employee and document data from legacy database
- Transforms and standardizes the data
- Uploads documents to AWS S3 with encryption
- Loads metadata into new database structure
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL database (source and target)
- AWS account with S3 access
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fdms-etl-poc
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp config.env.template config.env
```
Edit `config.env` with your actual credentials and configuration.

5. Create necessary directories:
```bash
mkdir logs
```

## Usage

Run the ETL process:
```bash
python fdms_etl.py
```

The program will:
1. Extract data from the source database
2. Transform the data according to the new schema
3. Upload documents to S3
4. Load metadata into the target database

Logs will be created in the `logs` directory with the format: `fdms_migration_YYYYMMDD.log`

## Project Structure

├── fdms_etl.py          # Main ETL script
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies

├── README.md           # This file
└── logs/               # Directory for log files
```

## Error Handling

The program includes comprehensive error handling:
- All operations are logged
- Exceptions are caught and logged
- Failed operations are reported with detailed error messages

## Security Considerations

- Database credentials and AWS keys are stored in environment variables
- S3 uploads use server-side encryption
- Sensitive data is logged securely

## Next Steps

1. Implement batch processing for large datasets
2. Add parallel processing capabilities
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms
4. Add data validation rules
5. Create monitoring dashboard
6. Implement progress tracking
